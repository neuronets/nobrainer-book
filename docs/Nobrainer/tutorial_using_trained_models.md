# Using pre-trained networks

Pre-trained networks are available in the [_Trained_ models](https://github.com/neuronets/trained-models)
repository. Prediction can be done on the command-line with `nobrainer predict`
or in Python. Similarly, generation can be done on the command-line with
`nobrainer generate` or in Python.
